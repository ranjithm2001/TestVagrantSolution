Logic
Base Case: When target == 0 ie further addition of numbers will make the sum > target.

For all cases when target >= 0, we add the current list to the solution set.

Here we add numbers to the list one by one, each time we are recursively calling the function, so that every combination is considered for which the sum <= target.
